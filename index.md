# Welcome to CVPaint

#### _By Noah D'Souza, Chase Joyner, & Rachel Won_

Our Software Design project utilizes OpenCV to track an object and use it as a cursor to a draw art. It will use your computer's camera to track a green object to begin drawing on the screen. The program has the capabilities of changing the color of your cursor and have and eraser to delete and miss guided/undintended strokes. You'll will have the function to save your creation afterwards!
